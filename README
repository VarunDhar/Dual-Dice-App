FUNCTIONS OF THE APP-
-> Displays 2 die, which can be rolled by pressing the button "Roll Die"
-> Dices roll independently, that is, different numbers should be expected most of the times
-> Used Constraint Layout, Toasts, Random Number feature, custom made assets for Dice, designed custom App logo

//Insert the dice1 to dice6 (PNG) photos into drawables folder.
//Also, I have changed the logo of the app.

//Colors were used for Button background, and overall App visuals.
